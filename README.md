# Super Mario Jump

### This project it's a **Super Mario-themed game**.
### It's a 2D game of running and jumping over obstacles made with *JavaScript*.

### This project was made based at the video tutorial of the ["Manual do Dev"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9buAwVBDhA&list=TLPQMTUwNDIwMjNjmWfuTuU70w&index=9) channel on Youtube. 

At follows, are the ***Programming Concepts*** that were used in this project:

1. **DOM manipulation**
   - The JavaScript code accesses the Document Object Model (DOM) to manipulate the elements on the webpage, such as the buttons, images, and text.

2. **Event handling**
   - The JavaScript code responds to user input events, such as clicking the "Restart" button, or pressing the space bar, by executing specific functions.

3. **Animation**
   - The game uses animation to move the images on the game board.

4. **CSS styling**
   - The game uses CSS to style the elements on the webpage, such as the colors, fonts, borders, and positioning.

5. **Audio playback**
   - The game uses JavaScript to play background music when the game is running.

6. **Loops**
   - The game uses loops to move the obstacles across the game board.

7. **Conditionals**
   - The game uses if-else statements to determine if Mario has collided with an obstacle, and if so, to end the game and display the score.

8. **Variables**
   - The game uses variables to keep track of the score, high score, and game state.

9. **Functions**
   - The game uses functions to handle game logic, such as updating the score, moving the obstacles, and checking for collisions.

10. **Math operations**
    - The game uses Math.random() to generate a random number to determine the position of obstacles on the game board.
